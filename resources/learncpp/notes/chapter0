Learning Objectives:

1. Programming Styles
2. Common Pitfalls
3. Debugging
4. Best Practices / Poor Practices
5. Testing


Optimal Method of Learning:
 - Type examples by hand
 - Practice!


Current Language Standard:
c++20


Best Applications of C++:
- High performance,
- Precise Control

    - Video Games
    - Real Time Systems
    - High Performance Financial Applications (high frequency trading)
    - Graphical Applications
    ...


C++ Dev Cycle:
1. Define
2. Design
3. Write
4. Compile
    c++ compiles code into .obj files. 
    .obj files are machine code versions of the code.


5. Link Object files
    linker program kicks in.
    Job of the linker program is to take all the files generated by the compiler and combine them into a single executable.

    It also links library files.


6. Test Program 
7. Debug -> 4

SO

Instead of setting up and IDE, like Visual Studio, 

I'm just using VsCode as a lightweight IDE.
